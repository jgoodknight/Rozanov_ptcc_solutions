\chapter*{Introduction}

I found this delightful-looking probability theory textbook at a book sale at Harvard University's Cabot science library in the Spring of 2012.  I really wanted to learn the contents of the book and I figured the best way to do that would be to read it and solve the problems as I went along.

Throughout the course of the book, I indicate whether or not my answers have been verified by an outside source.  When the logic to the answer seems to be central to the solution even though I know that the answer I eventually get to is correct, I will indicate it as not being verified.  

Verification sources include the textbook and university course webpages.  Due credit will be made wherever possible.
